You are given the head of a singly linked list head and a positive integer k.

You must reverse the first k nodes in the linked list, and then reverse the next k nodes, and so on. If there are fewer than k nodes left, leave the nodes as they are.

Return the modified list after reversing the nodes in each group of k.

You are only allowed to modify the nodes' next pointers, not the values of the nodes.

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
          cur = head
        group = 0
        while cur and group < k:
            cur = cur.next
            group += 1

        if group == k:
            cur = self.reverseKGroup(cur, k)
            while group > 0:
                tmp = head.next
                head.next = cur
                cur = head
                head = tmp
                group -= 1
            head = cur
        return head
