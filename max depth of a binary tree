Given the root of a binary tree, return its depth.

The depth of a binary tree is defined as the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Python Solution 

class Solution: 
    def maxDepth(self, root:Optional[TreeNode]) -> int: 
      if not root: 
        return 0 
      return 1 + max(self, maxDepth(root.left), (self, maxDepth(root.right));
