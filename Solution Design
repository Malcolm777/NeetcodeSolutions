The sliding window maximum problem is a classic problem in computer science. The brute force method to solve this problem has a time complexity of O(nk), where n is the length of the input array and k is the size of the sliding window. However, using a deque data structure, the time complexity can be reduced to O(n) 123.

The reason why the deque solution is O(n) is because each element is added to the deque exactly once and removed from the deque exactly once. The while loop that you mentioned is used to remove all elements from the deque that are smaller than the currently being added element. This while loop runs at most 2n times in total, which is O(n) 123.
